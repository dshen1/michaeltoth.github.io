-- General Discussion --

Implementation of the percolation problem in Javascript that was covered in
Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne's Algorithms class on Coursera:
https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI

Union Find Algorithm
    - Without this testing for percolation does not scale because it requires
      loops through bottom and top rows of sites
    - Implementing this makes testing for percolation trivial

-- Challenges --

Porting program from Javascript with well-defined class structures and
figuring out how this works in JS

Figuring out how to loop through opening sites and draw iteratively to the
screen (while loop is instant, but need delay)

Figuring out the HTML canvas operation

Figuring out how to cancel previous run when starting a new
run, etc

General design of the page
